# MinimIzed 2048
My application for the WWDC 2017 Scholarship. It is a version of 2048, only minimized for iOS devices and Apple's color scheme and design language.

I an considering making a version of this for the iOS App Store after WWDC called Yaco. Why Yaco? It's a random name I thought of just now as I'm typing this.

Please don't copy this playground. If you do, Apple will consider your application to be fabricated and you will be disqualified.
